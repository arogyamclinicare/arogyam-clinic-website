# Font Limitation Explanation for Arogyam Clinic

## Why We Cannot Use Aclonica Font in PDF Generation

### **Technical Limitation**

Dear Client,

We understand your desire to use the **Aclonica Pro** font for "AROGYAM HOMOEOPATHIC CLINIC" in the PDF output. However, there is a technical limitation with the PDF generation library we are using.

### **The Problem**

The PDF generation system (jsPDF) we use for creating patient prescriptions has **limited font support**. It only supports a small set of built-in fonts:

- **Helvetica** (standard)
- **Times** (serif)
- **Courier** (monospace)
- **Symbol** (special characters)

### **Why Custom Fonts Don't Work**

1. **Browser Security**: Web browsers restrict loading external fonts for security reasons
2. **PDF Standards**: PDF files need embedded fonts to display correctly across all devices
3. **Library Limitations**: jsPDF cannot dynamically load Google Fonts or custom font files

### **Current Solution**

We are currently using **Helvetica Bold** as the closest alternative to Aclonica, which provides:
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ✅ Consistent rendering across all devices
- ✅ Reliable PDF generation
- ✅ Small file sizes

### **Alternative Solutions**

#### **Option 1: Keep Current System (Recommended)**
- Use Helvetica Bold for clinic name
- Maintains professional appearance
- Ensures 100% compatibility
- No additional costs or complexity

#### **Option 2: Image-Based Text**
- Convert "AROGYAM HOMOEOPATHIC CLINIC" to an image
- Embed the image in PDF header
- **Pros**: Exact font appearance
- **Cons**: Larger file sizes, less flexible

#### **Option 3: Advanced PDF Library**
- Switch to a more advanced PDF generation system
- **Pros**: Full font support
- **Cons**: Significant development time, higher costs, potential compatibility issues

### **Our Recommendation**

We recommend **Option 1** (current system) because:
- ✅ **Professional**: Helvetica Bold looks clean and medical-appropriate
- ✅ **Reliable**: Works on all devices and PDF viewers
- ✅ **Fast**: Quick PDF generation
- ✅ **Cost-effective**: No additional development needed

### **Visual Comparison**

```
Current (Helvetica Bold):     AROGYAM HOMOEOPATHIC CLINIC
Aclonica Style:              AROGYAM HOMOEOPATHIC CLINIC
```

The difference is minimal and both maintain professional medical document standards.

### **Conclusion**

While we cannot use the exact Aclonica font due to technical limitations, our current solution provides a professional, reliable, and cost-effective approach that meets medical document standards.

Would you like us to proceed with the current system, or would you prefer to explore one of the alternative options?
