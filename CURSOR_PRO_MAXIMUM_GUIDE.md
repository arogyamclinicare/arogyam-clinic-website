"@docs update all relevant documentation for [feature-name] including API docs, user guide, and architecture docs"
```

### **B. Bug Fixing (5x Faster)**
```bash
# 1. AI Analysis
"@codebase analyze the [component/feature] and identify the root cause of [bug-description]"

# 2. AI Fix
"@composer fix the [bug-description] while maintaining backward compatibility and following security guidelines"

# 3. AI Validation
"@tests run all related tests and add new ones to prevent regression"
```

### **C. Code Refactoring (3x Faster)**
```bash
# 1. AI Analysis
"@codebase analyze [component/feature] for refactoring opportunities to improve performance, maintainability, and type safety"

## üîß **ADVANCED MCP TOOLS USAGE**

### **Supabase MCP (Database Operations)**
```bash
# Create tables
@supabase create table patients with columns: id, name, email, phone, created_at

# Run migrations
@supabase apply migration add_appointment_scheduling

# Execute SQL
@supabase execute SQL query to get all patients with pending consultations

# Generate types
@supabase generate TypeScript types for the database schema
```

### **Filesystem MCP (File Operations)**
```bash
# Read files
@filesystem read the PatientDashboard component and analyze its structure

# Write files
@filesystem create a new AppointmentScheduler component following the existing patterns

# Search files
@filesystem find all components that use the usePatient hook
```

### **Terminal MCP (Command Execution)**
```bash
# Run tests
@terminal run npm test and analyze the results

# Build project
@terminal run npm run build:prod and check for errors

# Deploy
@terminal run npm run deploy and monitor the deployment
```
