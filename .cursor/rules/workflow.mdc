# Workflow Rules for Context Engineering

## Purpose
This file contains workflow rules for using the Context Engineering system during development.

## File Usage Rules

### 1. Implementation Plan
- **When**: Starting new development phase or feature
- **How**: Reference implementation plan for current stage
- **Action**: Follow step-by-step tasks, don't skip ahead

### 2. Project Structure
- **When**: Creating new files or components
- **How**: Check project structure for proper organization
- **Action**: Maintain consistent folder structure and naming

### 3. UI/UX Documentation
- **When**: Working on frontend components or styling

- **Action**: Follow established design patterns and accessibility guidelines

### 4. Bug Tracking
- **When**: Encountering errors or issues
- **How**: Check bug tracking file first for known solutions
- **Action**: Document new issues and solutions

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup & Foundation
- Follow implementation plan step-by-step
- Set up project structure exactly as specified
- Install dependencies and configure tools

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Implement features in order specified
- Test each feature before moving to next
- Update bug tracking with any issues

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Build admin panel and advanced functionality
- Implement performance optimizations
- Add comprehensive testing

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
- Run full test suite
- Performance testing and optimization
- Deploy and monitor

## Quality Control
- Never skip implementation steps
- Always test before proceeding
- Document any deviations from plan
- Update relevant documentation files

## Context Management
- Keep workflow rules always loaded
- Reference specific files as needed
- Don't overload context with unnecessary information
- Focus on current development phase
